TODO:

- Function inlining
- Captured variables -> flag everything that could cause errors (mutliple assignments, taking address...)
- Mutexes
- Wait groups
- Timers
- Whitelist all library function calls without channels or functions as args or results
- Annoations for expected behaviour by libraries (when passed function)
- Flag calls to function variables


Improvements:
- Capturing variables (builder/ir/inliner)
- Renaming
- Remove ir.Variable.Handle()
