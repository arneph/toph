Note: All commands assume the current directory is the toph base directory, 
containining this file.

Toph can be installed in $GOBIN with:

go install toph.go

The test-runners folder contains script-like programs to run Toph and Uppaal 
for everything in the tests directory. Run them with:

go run test_runners/toph-runner.go
go run test_runners/uppaal-runner.go

uppaal-runner.go starts the Uppaal verifier binary in sub-processes. This 
requires that the "uppaalPath" variable points at a directory containing the 
Uppaal commandline binaries, e.g. "bin-Darwin" on macOS.
